# Quality Rubric

> Defines what "good" means for this vault. Scored dimensions guide validation and self-assessment. This rubric evolves — refine criteria as understanding of the vault deepens.

## Dimensions

### Accuracy (Weight: Critical)
- Factual claims in notes are correct and current.
- External links work. Internal links resolve.
- No information presented as fact that is actually fabricated or unverified.
- Sources cited where appropriate.

### Structure & Navigability (Weight: Critical)
- Notes are findable through folder browsing, search, or link traversal.
- Folder hierarchy has clear semantics — a note's location makes sense.
- Naming conventions are consistent and descriptive.
- Maps of Content or index notes exist for major topic areas.

### Interconnection (Weight: High)
- Related notes link to each other bidirectionally where appropriate.
- No orphan notes that should be connected to the graph.
- Tags are used consistently and add navigational value.
- The knowledge graph has meaningful structure, not just random connections.

### Completeness (Weight: High)
- Notes that serve as references cover their topic adequately.
- Stubs are identified and either expanded or explicitly marked as stubs.
- No half-finished thoughts left without context or a clear `#stub` / `#wip` marker.

### Consistency (Weight: Medium)
- Frontmatter schema is uniform within each note type.
- Formatting conventions (heading levels, list styles, callout usage) are consistent.
- Tag taxonomy doesn't have synonymous duplicates.
- Templates are used where they exist.

### Clarity (Weight: Medium)
- Notes are readable by someone encountering them for the first time.
- Dense notes have structure (headings, sections) that aids scanning.
- Jargon is either defined or the note's context makes it clear.
- Writing serves the reader — no unnecessary padding.

### Safety (Weight: Critical)
- No private data (passwords, financial details, personal identifiers) exposed in notes that might be shared.
- Guardrails respected. Author's meaning preserved.
- No content fabricated without verification markers.

## Scoring (Self-Assessment)
After each iteration, rate each dimension 1–5 in the iteration log:
- **5**: Excellent — no issues found, vault improved in this dimension.
- **4**: Good — minor issues noted, nothing impactful.
- **3**: Acceptable — some gaps remain, no regressions.
- **2**: Below standard — issues need follow-up next iteration.
- **1**: Failure — regression, meaning altered, or content fabricated. Must be resolved before continuing.

Any dimension scoring 1 blocks iteration completion until resolved.
