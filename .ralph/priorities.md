# Priorities

> Ordered by impact. Top items get worked first. Updated every iteration based on new discoveries.

## Active

### P-001: Vault Discovery & Baseline (Iteration 1)
- Map the full vault structure: folders, note count per folder, tag taxonomy, frontmatter conventions.
- Identify linking patterns: average links per note, orphan notes, broken links.
- Document conventions already in use: naming patterns, frontmatter schema, heading styles, tag prefixes.
- Establish baseline metrics: total notes, orphan count, broken link count, notes without frontmatter, stub notes (< 100 words with no links).

### P-002: Project Brief Completeness (Iteration 1)
- Verify the Project Brief has been filled with substantive content (not just placeholders).
- If still empty, flag as P0 blocker — all downstream work depends on it.
- Ensure downstream notes reference the Project Brief as their source of truth.

### P-003: Domain Structure Validation (Iteration 1–2)
- Verify the chosen domain folders make sense for the project type.
- Check that seed notes within each domain are well-structured and interconnected.
- Identify missing domains or notes that should exist but don't.
- Verify `_MOC.md` accurately reflects the domain structure.

### P-004: Structural Consistency (Iteration 1–2)
- Verify all frontmatter follows the vault's conventions: `tags`, `status`.
- Verify heading hierarchy: H1 title after frontmatter, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections.
- Verify all wikilinks resolve.
- Check template usage is consistent.

### P-005: Content Quality & Depth (Iteration 2–3)
- Identify notes that need deeper content or refinement.
- Ensure consistent structure within each note type/domain.
- Check that reference material is complete and current.

### P-006: Knowledge Graph Health (Iteration 3+)
- Identify disconnected clusters that should link to each other.
- Surface implicit connections: notes that discuss the same concept but don't reference each other.
- Verify bidirectional linking where relationships are mutual.
- Improve tag consistency: merge synonymous tags, establish tag hierarchy if one is emerging.

### P-007: Convention Documentation (Iteration 3+)
- Document the vault's discovered conventions in a vault-internal note.
- Conventions to document: frontmatter schema, heading hierarchy, tag taxonomy, file naming, wikilink patterns.
- This note becomes the reference for future iterations and for the human to review/edit.
